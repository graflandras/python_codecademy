# A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool.
# Modules are also often referred to as “libraries” or “packages” — a package is really a
# directory that holds a collection of modules. Usually, to use a module in a file,
# the basic syntax you need at the top of that file is:

# from module_name import object_name

# Often, a library will include a lot of code that you don’t need that may slow down
# your program or conflict with existing code. Because of this, it makes sense to only
# import what you need. One common library that comes as part of the Python Standard
# Library is datetime. datetime helps you work with dates and times in Python.

from datetime import datetime
current_time = datetime.now()
print(current_time)
